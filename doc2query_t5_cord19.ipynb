We show that even distantly related viruses within a viral family share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity; reinforce how fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny; and highlight the evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure. We do so by (for each dataset) unveiling a set of phenotype characteristic mutations which are shown to be functionally relevant, thus providing new insights into phenotypic relationships between RNA viruses. These methods also provide a solid statistical framework with which the degree of host adaptation can be inferred, thus serving as a valuable tool for studying host transition events with particular relevance for emerging infectious diseases. These methods can then serve as rigorous tools of emergence potential assessment, specifically in scenarios where rapid host classification of newly emerging viruses can be more important than identifying putative functional sites.\"),\n",

This would include identifying policy and programmatic alternatives that lessen/mitigate risks to critical government services\", \"Mitigation of a severe influenza pandemic can be achieved using a range of interventions to reduce transmission. Interventions can reduce the impact of an outbreak and buy time until vaccines are developed, but they may have high social and economic costs. The non-linear effect on the epidemic dynamics means that suitable strategies crucially depend on the precise aim of the intervention. National pandemic influenza plans rarely contain clear statements of policy objectives or prioritization of potentially conflicting aims, such as minimizing mortality (depending on the severity of a pandemic) or peak prevalence or limiting the socio-economic burden of contact-reducing interventions. We use epidemiological models of influenza A to investigate how contact-reducing interventions and availability of antiviral drugs or pre-pandemic vaccines contribute to achieving particular policy objectives. Our analyses show that the ideal strategy depends on the aim of an intervention and that the achievement of one policy objective may preclude success with others, e.g., constraining peak demand for public health resources may lengthen the duration of the epidemic and hence its economic and social impact. Constraining total case numbers can be achieved by a range of strategies, whereas strategies which additionally constrain peak demand for services require a more sophisticated intervention. If, for example, there are multiple objectives which must be achieved prior to the availability of a pandemic vaccine (i.e., a time-limited intervention), our analysis shows that interventions should be implemented several weeks into the epidemic, not at the very start.\"),\n",

Antibodies to the S protein produced by the host result in enhanced infection of macrophages via Fc receptors, and the infected macrophages then transport the virus throughout the body. In the enhanced infection there is a decrease in incubation timeâ€”as short as 1â€“2 daysâ€”after exposure to virulent FIPV. The relative amount of virus and antibodies is important in order for ADE to occur. Higher concentrations of antibody neutralize the virus, but as the concentration of antibody decreases a concentration occurs where enhanced infection results.

For example, the University of California, SanFrancisco (UCSF) has mandated telemedicine be used to care for palliative care and nonpalliative care patients in ambulatory settings, whenever possible. Similarly, many hospice agencies are currently offering most, if not all, social work and chaplaincy support by telemedicine.
